When kids go back to school we go on holidays :) But before that we just release new light-baseimage versions and some new docker images!

# New light-baseimage images

Alpine is here! In beta for now an Alpine version of light-baseimage is now availaible.
More info on [Alpine-light-baseimage GitHub](https://github.com/osixia/docker-light-baseimage/tree/feature-linux-alpine).

Alipne offer a much more light weight image and speed up deployment time:

  - osixia/alpine-light-baseimage: 44.88 MB
  - osixia/light-baseimage (debian jessie): 166.7 MB
  - osixia/ubuntu-light-baseimage: 217.1 MB


We also added some more options to all light-baseimage images please refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/osixia/docker-light-baseimage/blob/stable/CHANGELOG.md).

All our docker images bases on light-baseimage have been updated.
