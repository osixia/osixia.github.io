You can also install as many themes as you like and switch to the one you prefer in any time.\n\nVia Git (GitHub)\n\nThe easiest way to install new theme is via theme-add, the following command will install theme Curtana from its official repo amsf/amsf-curtana:\n\n$ grunt theme-add --theme=curtana\n\n\n\nIf you’d install custom theme from other users, append --user in your command, the following command will install a new theme named bootstrap-sass from sparanoid/amsf-bootstrap-sass\n\n$ grunt theme-add --theme=bootstrap-sass --user=sparanoid\n\n\n\nManually Install\n\nYou can also install themes manually. find an AMSF theme (Curtana, for example), download the package and uncompress all files to _amsf/themes directory, the file structure should look like:\n\n├── _amsf/ (Almace Scaffolding cache directory)\n|   ├── themes/\n|   |   └── curtana/\n|   |   |   └── assets/\n|   |   |   └── includes/\n|   |   |   └── layouts/\n|   |   |   └── pages/\n|   |   |   └── config.yml\n└── _app/\n\n\n\nThen execute the following command:\n\n$ grunt activate --theme=curtana\n\n\n\nYou current theme will be backed up to _amsf/themes/your-old-theme/ and the new theme curtana will be installed to the appropriate directories.\n\nUpgrading Themes\n\nYou can update your current activated theme by the following command. The activated theme will be downloaded from GitHub automatically if there’s any update:\n\n$ grunt theme-update\n\n\n\nPlease note that only themes added via GitHub can be updated.\n","excerpt":"Overview\n\n","languages":null,"categories":["note"],"tags":["customization"]},{"title":"Creating Your Own Theme","permalink":"https://osixia.github.io/lab/amsf/creating-themes.html","link":"https://osixia.github.io/lab/amsf/creating-themes.html","date":"2014-06-09T00:00:00+02:00","modified":"2016-06-01T10:35:58+02:00","author":{"name":"Osixia","url":"http://sparanoid.com/","email":"contact@sparanoid.com"},"content":"Overview\n\nYou can create your own theme in AMSF, theme files are located in the following location (I use default theme Curtana here for better understanding):\n\n├── _app/\n|   ├── _data/\n|   |   └── curtana.yml\n|   ├── _includes/\n|   |   └── themes/\n|   |   |   └── curtana/\n|   |   |   |   └── includes/\n|   |   |   |   └── layouts/\n|   ├── _pages/\n|   |   └── themes/\n|   |   |   └── curtana/\n|   |   |   |   └── example-page.md\n|   |   |   |   └── ...\n|   ├── assets/\n|   |   └── themes/\n|   |   |   └── curtana/\n|   |   |   |   └── _js/\n|   |   |   |   └── _less/\n|   |   |   |   └── ...\n\n\n\nThe theme specific config curtana.yml should have the same filename as your theme name. It should contain theme specific variables and can also override AMSF built-in settings.\n\nMore info about theme structure you can check out my default theme Curtana.\n\nYou can also have multiple themes in your project, as many as you like. For example if you also have themes Bootstrap and Ghost installed, the file structure should be:\n\n├── _app/\n|   ├── _data/\n|   |   └── bootstrap.yml\n|   |   └── curtana.yml\n|   |   └── ghost.yml\n|   ├── _includes/\n|   |   └── themes/\n|   |   |   └── bootstrap/\n|   |   |   |   └── includes/\n|   |   |   |   └── layouts/\n|   |   |   └── curtana/\n|   |   |   |   └── includes/\n|   |   |   |   └── layouts/\n|   |   |   └── ghost/\n|   |   |   |   └── includes/\n|   |   |   |   └── layouts/\n|   ├── _pages/\n|   |   └── themes/\n|   |   |   └── bootstrap/\n|   |   |   |   └── example-about.md\n|   |   |   |   └── example-blog.md\n|   |   |   |   └── example-fluid-container.md\n|   |   |   |   └── ...\n|   |   |   └── curtana/\n|   |   |   |   └── example-about.md\n|   |   |   |   └── example-news.md\n|   |   |   |   └── ...\n|   |   |   └── ghost/\n|   |   |   |   └── example-archive.md\n|   |   |   |   └── example-page.md\n|   |   |   |   └── example-tagcloud.md\n|   |   |   |   └── ...\n|   ├── assets/\n|   |   └── themes/\n|   |   |   └── bootstrap/\n|   |   |   |   └── _coffee/\n|   |   |   |   └── _less/\n|   |   |   |   └── images/\n|   |   |   └── curtana/\n|   |   |   |   └── _js/\n|   |   |   |   └── _less/\n|   |   |   |   └── svg/\n|   |   |   └── ghost/\n|   |   |   |   └── _js/\n|   |   |   |   └── _scss/\n|   |   |   |   └── fonts/\n...\n\n\n\nAMSF Options\n\nThere’re several built-in options you can use in your theme. These options can also be overridden in theme specific config.\n\nsite.name\n\nTemplate:\n\n&lt;footer class=\"footer\"&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;{{ site.name }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/atom.xml\"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n&lt;footer class=\"footer\"&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;Almace Scaffolding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/atom.xml\"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/footer&gt;\n\n\n\nsite.description\n\nSite description, will appear in the document meta and Atom feed subtitle.\n\nTemplate:\n\n&lt;meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"{{ site.description }}\"&gt;\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n&lt;meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Super-fast Jekyll framework\"&gt;\n\n\n\nsite.base\n\nBase URL, this is useful when you need to build site in a subdirectory (like GitHub Pages for Projects), it provides a specific URL prefix, for example, if the production site URL is http://sparanoid.com/lab/amsf/, set base to /lab/amsf, without trailing slash. This make sure all the links are relative to current site root (in a subdirectory in this case), you should use this variable for every link appeared in your theme.\n\nConfig:\n\nbase: /lab/amsf\n\n\n\nTemplate:\n\n&lt;a href=\"{{ site.base }}/atom.xml\"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n&lt;a href=\"/lab/amsf/atom.xml\"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nsite.file\n\nMedia assets URL used in posts, without trailing slash. In the most cases this URL should be powered by a CDN provider.\n\nConfig:\n\nfile: //d349cztnlupsuf.cloudfront.net\n\n\n\nTemplate:\n\n&lt;img src=\"{{ site.file }}/post-thumbnail.jpg\"&gt;\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n&lt;img src=\"//d349cztnlupsuf.cloudfront.net/post-thumbnail.jpg\"&gt;\n\n\n\nsite.twitter\n\nSite Twitter account handle.\n\nTemplate:\n\n&lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}\"&gt;Follow @{{ site.twitter }} on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n&lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/sparanoid\"&gt;Follow @sparanoid on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nsite.force_utf_8\n\nForce UTF-8 encoding, enable this will simply add &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt; to the head of your pages.\n\nTemplate:\n\n{% if site.force_utf_8 %}\n  &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\n\n\nsite.robots\n\nYou can define your own records in robots.txt.\n\nConfig:\n\nrobots:\n  - \"User-agent: *\"\n  - \"Disallow: /ajax/\"\n  - \"Disallow: /@async\"\n  - \"Disallow: /log/\"\n\n\n\nTheme Features\n\nThere’re some features can be integrated into your theme.\n\n(Basic) Multi-Language Support\n\nYou can define post / page language in your front-matter field:\n\nlanguages:\n  - zh-tw\n\n\n\nAn additional lang HTML attribute will be added to your final rendering:\n\n&lt;article lang=\"zh-tw\"&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\n\n\nIf your post / page content is multilingual, you can also define multiple languages in array:\n\nlanguages:\n  - zh-tw\n  - en-us\n\n\n\nPlease note that only the first item defined in languages array will be used in final lang output, the additional languages will be available in JSON feed output:\n\n{\n  \"languages\": [\"zh-tw\", \"en-us\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"note\"],\n  \"tags\": [\"miscellaneous\"]\n}\n\n\n\nSmooshing Assets\n\nFor better performance, Almace Scaffolding will find all the CSS, script links and images in compiled HTML, and outputs a version with all the CSS, scripts and images (Base64) written inline. Sounds cool? but it needs theme support. Here’s how:\n\nYou can simply add the query string ?assets-inline at the end of the file you’d like to be inlined in production site:\n\n&lt;!-- This CSS will be inlined into HTML --&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ '/css/app.css?assets-inline' | prepend: amsf_theme_assets }}\"&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- This script will be inlined into HTML --&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"{{ '/js/app.js?assets-inline' | prepend: amsf_theme_assets }}\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\nUser Custom Styles Support\n\nDefine the following code snippet into your theme styles (Less) will allow users to custom your theme without touching the theme files:\n\n// Import user custom styles\n@import \"../../../_less/custom\";\n\n\n\nUser Custom Scripts Support\n\nDefine the following code snippet into your theme template (it’s recommended to put it in footer) will allow users to add custom scripts without touching the theme files:\n\n&lt;!-- User custom scripts --&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"{{ '/js/user.js?assets-inline' | prepend: amsf_user_assets }}\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\nPage / Post Specific CSS Block Support\n\nThis allow your user to define page / post specific CSS blocks in front-matter data:\n\n&lt;!-- Page-wide custom CSS --&gt;\n{{ amsf_page_css }}\n\n\n\nGoogle Analytics Support\n\nThis allow your user to be able to use Google Analytics for their site, tracking ID can be changed in config file:\n\n&lt;!-- Google Analytics tracking code --&gt;\n{{ amsf_google_analytics }}\n\n\n\nPost Published Time\n\nThis allow you to get the published time of current post.\n\nTemplate:\n\n&lt;meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"{{ amsf_page_pubdate | date_to_xmlschema }}\"&gt;\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n&lt;meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2014-01-01T00:00:00+08:00\"&gt;\n\n\n\nPost Modified Time\n\nThis allow you to get the modified time of current post.\n\nTemplate:\n\n&lt;meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"{{ amsf_page_update | date_to_xmlschema }}\"&gt;\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n&lt;meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2014-01-03T03:17:49+08:00\"&gt;\n\n\n\nPost Reading Time\n\nThis allow you to show average reading time of current post.\n\nTemplate:\n\nReading time: {{ amsf_page_reading_time | strip }}\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n# Less than 200 words\nReading time: Less than 1 min\n\n# Around 200 words\nReading time: 1 min\n\n# More than 200 words\nReading time: 34 mins\n\n# More than 1 hour\nReading time: 1 hr\nReading time: 1 hr 1 min\nReading time: 3 hrs 20 mins\n\n\n\nPublishing Themes\n\nYou really like your custom design and wanna show it off to the world? Cool, you can create (pack) you own theme by the following command:\n\n$ grunt theme-save\n\n\n\nThe activated theme will be saved to AMSF cache (_amsf/) with correct file and directory structure, then you can upload your theme to GitHub.\n\nStill confusing? see my default theme Curtana for reference.\n","excerpt":"Overview\n\n","languages":null,"categories":["note"],"tags":["customization"]},{"title":"Syntax Highlighting","permalink":"https://osixia.github.io/lab/amsf/syntax-highlighting.html","link":"https://osixia.github.io/lab/amsf/syntax-highlighting.html","date":"2014-06-06T00:00:00+02:00","modified":"2016-06-01T10:35:58+02:00","author":{"name":"Osixia","url":"http://sparanoid.com/","email":"contact@sparanoid.com"},"content":"Code highlighting demo, powered by Rouge.

He is mentioned twice in the Encyclopaedia Britannica as someone’s teacher. There could be no greater lapse: for two important decades (the 60s and the 70s), Althusser was at the eye of all the important cultural storms. He fathered quite a few of them.\n  This newly-found obscurity forces me to summarize his work before suggesting a few (minor) modifications to it.\n    \n      Society consists of practices: economic, political and ideological.\n        \n          Althusser defines a practice as:\n          “Any process of transformation of a determinate product, affected by a determinate human labour, using determinate means (of production)”\n            \n              The economic practice (the historically specific mode of production) transforms raw materials to finished products using human labour and other means of production, all organized within defined webs of inter-relations. The political practice does the same with social relations as the raw materials. Finally, ideology is the transformation of the way that a subject relates to his real life conditions of existence.\n                \n                  This is a rejection of the mechanistic worldview (replete with bases and superstructures). It is a rejection of the Marxist theorization of ideology. It is a rejection of the Hegelian fascist “social totality”. It is a dynamic, revealing, modern day model.\n                  “The objective internal reference … the system of questions commanding the answers given”\n                \n              \n              Subjects to what? The answer: to the material practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects) is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”. These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , forcing the individuals to generate meaning (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.\n                \n                  Subjects to what? The answer: to the material practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects) is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”. These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , forcing the individuals to generate meaning (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.\n                  What happens in a pluralistic environment rich in competing ideologies?\n                    \n                      Clarifying the HOW, though, does not shed light on the WHY.\n                        \n                          is the fact that in the new one, the second text is articulated with the lapses in the first text … (Marx measures) the problematic contained\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              Ideology is a practice with lived and material dimensions. It has costumes, rituals, behaviour patterns, ways of thinking. The State employs Ideological Apparatuses (ISAs) to reproduce ideology through practices and productions: (organized) religion, the education system, the family, (organized) politics, the media, the industries of culture.\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n  These theoretical tools were widely used to analyze the Advertising and the film industries.\n\n\n\n  Ordered list\n  Ordered list\n    \n      Ordered list\n        \n          Ordered list\n          Ordered list\n            \n              Ordered list\n                \n                  Ordered list\n                  Ordered list\n                \n              \n              Ordered list\n                \n                  Ordered list\n                \n              \n              Ordered list\n            \n          \n        \n      \n      Ordered list\n        \n          Ordered list\n          Ordered list\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Ordered list\n\n\n\n\n“This should be replaced.”\n\n“This should be replaced.”\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n‘This should be replaced.’\n\n‘This should be replaced.’\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n「This should be replaced.」\n\n「This should be replaced.」\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n『This should be replaced.』\n\n『This should be replaced.』\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n（This should be replaced.）\n\n（This should be replaced.）\n\nThis is a normal paragraph.\n\n\n\nMost of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.\n\nMaui and his rough as guts piece of pounamu, what a stink buzz.

Though he seemed disinterested, vaguely detached, he had obviously heard of HIV before. His chart from the local clinic indicated a previous history of and treatment for anal gonorrhea, two acute cases of syphilis in the past three years, and a urinary tract infection last month. His only listed sexual contact, his wife. Who, strangely enough, only tested positive for one of the syphilis infections.\n\n“Mistake, this! I am married, not a giver of ass.”\n\nGiver of ass? That’s one for the archive, I think.\n\nUnwilling to engage his obvious denials, I ignore the comment and instead explain that due to a higher than acceptable potential of a false positive result, we won’t consider his oral test as confirmatory until the more accurate blood analysis is in.\n\n“I no understand”, he says to the room in general.\n\nHis annoyance is obvious. Abrasively, he offers me his exposed forearm. This, I assume, is my cue to draw his blood. Ignoring the indignant anger beginning to rise, I tighten my jaw, then swab the fat vein with betadine, working the cool, brown liquid off in concentric circles, using strong medicinal smelling alcohol. I use the betadine, as most of these men work in the mines, and dirt three layers thick on exposed skin is the norm. As the first tube in the vacationer fills with blood, he asks,\n\n“So how I get this thing?”\n\nAh, I see we are going to play the circuitous dance of ignorance. Sounding just a little too clinical, I begin the HIV 101 mantra.\n\n“Well, people acquire HIV through certain types of sex with an infected person, through sharing needles with an infected person, and sometimes through a blood transfusion. Have you ever had a blood transfusion, sir?”\n\nI take the dismissive wave of his hand as a no to the transfusion question. I don’t make a great attempt to navigate a comfort zone here; instinct and experience telling me he has already set the script of what is to follow.\n\n“She is fucking other cocks my whore devil wife”?\nBingo!

There’re some factors that prevent it from generating pages:\n\n\n  Many features Almace Scaffolding provides like live reloading, Less support, inline SVG, and HTML minification are implemented using Grunt.js, it’s not supported by GitHub Pages.\n  Almace Scaffolding uses the latest pre-release Jekyll, so not all features are supported by GitHub Pages renderers.\n  GItHub Pages build server overwrites the source settings. This prevent it generating pages from current file structure.\n\n\nThe Solution\n\nI know this can be tricky and more verbose than uploading your Jekyll site directly to your repository. However GitHub Pages support static HTML pages, a workaround solution for using Almace Scaffolding on GitHub Pages is treating your Jekyll site as static pages:\n\n\n  Build your site locally (grunt build).\n  Upload Jekyll generated static files to your username.github.io repository.\n\n\nIf you’d like to keep all things under Git control, you can try the following file structure:\n\n├── _amsf/ (Almace Scaffolding source code)\n├── *.html (Jekyll-generated static pages)\n└── README.md (your own readme)\n\n\n\nYou can see this live demo how to make them friends.\n","excerpt":"The Problem\n\n","languages":null,"categories":["note"],"tags":["deployment"]}]
